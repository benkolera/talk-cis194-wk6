            <p>Hello everyone and welcome to week 6 of Introduction to Haskell.</p>
            <p>This week we finally demystify one of the most interesting (and sometimes confronting) aspects of haskell; its pervasive laziness.</p>
            <p>Laziness gives rise to some interesting abstractions but is not without its tradeoffs; all of which I'm excited to explore them with you this evening.</p>

            <h1>Strict<br />Evaluation</h1>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>But before we talk about lazy evaluation, we should really talk about what its opposite is, Strict Evaluation.</p>
            </aside>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Strict Evaluation</h2>
            <br /> 
            <pre><code data-trim class="hs">
f x y = x + 2
            </code></pre>
            <br />
            <p>To evaluate f, all arguments are fully evaluated before being passed into the function.</p>
            <br /> 
            <pre class="fragment"><code data-trim class="hs">
f 5 (reallyReallyRidiculouslyExpensiveFunction 10)
f 5 42  -- Pay the expensive cost of calculating the second expression                                         
5 + 2   -- (evaluate function body)
7
            </code></pre>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>All arguments of a function are evaluated before the body is evaluated</p>
              <p><[click] Because they are evaluated before the body, they must be evaluated regardless of whether they are used.</p>
            </aside>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Why Strict Evaluation?</h2>
            <p>Easy to predict evaluation order. Consider this code:</p>
            <pre><code data-trim class="scala">
f(releaseMonkey(),incrementCounter())
            </code></pre>
            <p>The effects will happen left-to-right regardless of f.</p>
            <p>It would make it very difficult to reason about this code if evaluation order was not easily predictable.</p>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>The power of strict evaluation is the simplicity of predicting what order things are run in.</p>
              <p>Consider this code, and how in traditional languages you can easily reason the fact that we'll always release a monkey and increment a count in precisely that order.</p>
              <p>If the two arguments could get evaluated in any order (or not at all) based on what f does, it would make java more difficult than it already is. :)</p>

            <h1>Side Effects <br />& Purity</h1>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>What we are really talking about are the presence/absence of side-effects.</p>
            </aside>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Side Effects</h2>
            <p>Time dependent operations require an easily predictable evaluation order. Examples are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li class="fragment">Reading/Modifying a shared variable</li>   
              <li class="fragment">Printing to the screen</li>   
              <li class="fragment">Reading from a file or network</li>
            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>
                Any operation that can return something different depending on when it is called obviously needs to be evaluated in a predictable order.
              </p>
              <p>[click] Reading/Modifying a shared variable can change outputs as the value changes.</p>
              <p>[click] Printing to the screen may need to be done in a certain order to make sense.</p>
              <p>[click] Network and file IO share the same problem as shared variables and the screen combined.</p>
            </aside>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Laziness forces Purity</h2>
            <p>Haskell was designed to be lazy.</p>
            <p>Quickly became apparent that haskell needed to enforce purity / disallow side effects.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>But we need side effects!</h2>
            <p>Don't worry; Haskell does has them.</p>
            <p>Are just separated into a DSL that forces sequential evaluation.</p>
            <p>We separate our code into sequential bits and pure bits, keeping laziness and purity where it is useful.</p>

            <h1>Lazy Evaluation</h1>
            <p>(Mostly the opposite of Strict evaluation, but <a target="_blank" href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Lazy_vs._non-strict">not entirely</a>)</p>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Lazy Evalutation is, for our purposes, the opposite of strict evaluation.</p>
              <p>Involves delaying the evaluation of expressions as long as possible.</p>
            </aside>
          </section> 
          <section>
            <h2>Thunks</h2>
            <p>Expressions are not evaluated and are instead passed around as unevaluated computations called
              <a target="_blank" href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Thunk">thunks</a>.</p>
            <pre class="fragment"><code data-trim class="hs">
f x y = x + 2
f 5 (reallyReallyRidiculouslyExpensiveFunction 10)
f 5 {thunk} -- Expensive function is wrapped in a thunk
5 + 2       -- Thunk can be garbage collected and never evaluated
            </code></pre>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Expressions are not evaluated immediately and are instead passed around as unevaluated thunks.</p>
              <p>[click] Take our previous code example.</p>
              <p>The expensive function starts its life as a thunk and ends up garbage collected without doing any work.</p>

          <section>
            <h2>Pattern Matching drives Evaluation</h2>
            <p>Consider the differences between these two functions:</p>
            <pre><code data-trim class="haskell">
f1 :: Maybe a -> [Maybe a]
f1 m = [m,m]    

f2 :: Maybe a -> a
f2 Nothing  = []
f2 (Just x) = x    
            </code></pre>
            <p>f1 does not inspect the shape of m, so it is left as a thunk.</p>
            <p>While f2 needs to evaluate the maybe, x is left unevaluated.</p>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>F1 does not inspect the shape of the maybe, so m is left unevaluated.</p>
              <p>Aside: It is for this reason that f1 would be written with a type of a -> [a]</p>
              <p>x is not patterned matched and will only be evaluated if the result is pattern matched elsewhere</p>
            </aside>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Key Points</h2>
            <p>Expressions are only evaluated when pattern matched.</p>
            <p>... and are only evaluated as much as the pattern needs.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Example</h2>
            <pre><code data-trim class="haskell">

foldl :: (b -> a -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
foldl _ z []     = z
foldl f z (x:xs) = foldl f (f z x) xs

              <p>Since the accumulator value is never pattern matched, we just build up a big old thunk that is as long as the list is.</p>
              <p>This is okay for a small list, but for a big list it wastes a lot of memory. Summing 1 to 1 billion consumes all 8GB of my memory and never terminates.</p>

True  && x  = x
False && _  = False

            <h2>Effectively Infinite Structures</h2>
            <p>Laziness is also quite useful for very large problem spaces, like all moves in a chess game.</p>
            <p>Can define a function that generates a thunk for the entire problem space without costing space/time.</p>
            <p>Moves are just pulled off as they are needed by the consumer.</p>
            <p>Separating generation and consumption leads to very modular code.</p>

              <p>One of the coolest things about laziness is non-nonsense dynamic programming.</p>
              <p>You normally need to be very careful to fill in entries of the table in the right order.</p>
              <p>Whereas with laziness you can just define things recursively and the table is generated as needed.</p>
              <p>We don't have time to go into this in depth.</p>

          <h2>Wrap Up</h2>
          <p class="fragment">Laziness keeps us honest with our side effects.</p>
          <p class="fragment">There are some (at times painful) difficulties reasoning about space usage.</p>
          <p class="fragment">But in turn we gain some really interesting and powerful abstractions without special cases.</p>
          <p class="fragment">Seems like a better default to have purity and safe laziness by design rather than potentially buggy and opaque laziness (ala scala,python)</p>
